# ioscrashhill_v1
# a webkit exploit that allows to crash safari
Current Exploit is only for iOS 15.3+ as it exploits a vulnerability in audioworklet again!(thanks to Apple!), + also as there is no kernel exploit for 15.5 yet (however, there are multiple kernel vulnerabilities that may be usable, there just aren't exploits for them yet) this won't work until an exploit is written for one of those vulnerabilities, that is mean you can not run exploit on IOS 15.2 and lower versions.
thanks to A.ma for made exploit to allow me create a update exploit.
this is a V1 and can update soon
